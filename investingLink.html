      <h1>Investing: The Fun Ride for Your Money</h1>
      <p>
        Think of investing like planting a money tree—you buy an asset, hold it
        for a while, and sell it later, hoping it’s grown into a bigger tree! 🍎
        Goal? 🌱 Beat inflation! This is when your money loses value over time
        because everything gets more expensive—kind of like how candy used to be
        cheaper when we were kids!

      <h2>Inflation Basics</h2>
      <p>
        Inflation is like an invisible money-eating monster. How Inflation
        occurs? Governments print more money 🖨️, things get more expensive, and
        before you know it, your cash can’t buy as much anymore. Fun Fact: In a
        2020 survey by the European Central Bank, only 30% of financial wealth
        is invested. Let’s change that!

        the riskier it is! We measure this with volatility and standard
        deviation (SD) 📉—fancy words to say how much returns bounce around.
        High SD = Risky! 😲 Low SD = Safer! 😌
